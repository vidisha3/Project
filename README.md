# 🏀 NBA Player Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Explanation  
This project focuses on analyzing and understanding data related to professional basketball players using Python. The dataset contains biographical and career-related information such as:

- Height (`Ht`)
- Weight (`Wt`)
- Playing position (`Pos`)
- Birth date
- College
- Career duration

---

## 🎯 Objectives

### 🧹 1. Preprocessing & Cleaning
- Convert raw fields like height (`6-9`) into numerical format (inches).
- Handle missing values.
- Encode categorical features for modeling.

### 📊 2. Visualize Player Attributes
- Distribution of player heights and weights.
- Relationship between height and weight.
- Trends in career length by position.

### 📈 3. Understand Key Relationships
- How physical attributes affect:
  - Player position
  - Career longevity

### 🤖 4. Build Predictive Models
Using supervised machine learning regressors to predict attributes (e.g., weight) based on other features.

#### Models Used:
- 🔹 Linear Regression  
- 🌲 Random Forest Regressor  
- 📈 Gradient Boosting Regressor
