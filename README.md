##ðŸ’¡ Project Explanation
This project focuses on analyzing and understanding data related to professional basketball players using Python. The dataset contains biographical and career-related information such as height, weight, playing position, college, and career span.

ðŸ§  Objectives:
Preprocess and Clean the Data
Convert raw text fields (like height in 6-9 format) into usable numerical formats, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables so they can be used in machine learning models.

Visualize Player Attributes
Use plots to explore the distribution of player heights, compare height and weight, and understand how long players typically stay in the league.

Understand Relationships
Study how physical attributes (like height and weight) correlate with other variables such as playing position or career length.

Build Predictive Models
Use machine learning regressors such as:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting Regressor

to predict player weight based on features like height, position, and college.

Evaluate Performance
Measure how accurate the predictions are using metrics such as:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

RÂ² Score
